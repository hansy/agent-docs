# AGENTS.md

## Must-read (in order)

1. Product context: docs/PRD.md
2. Agent state docs: docs/agents/STATE.md
3. Agent state: docs/agents/state.json (read `plan_slug`, `current_role`, `state`, `msg`)

## Assume Role

Assume the `current_role`. Read the relevant role guide found in `docs/agents/roles/<current_role>.md` to understand what your role entails.

## Local AGENTS.md

If an AGENTS.md exists in a package/app, read it after this file; its rules are stricter for that scope.
