# Roadmap (template - replace with actual roadmap)

## Conventions

- Feature IDs: `F###` (e.g., F001). Task IDs: `T##` (e.g., T01).
- Slugs: kebab‑case. Feature slug: `F###-<feature>`.
- Branches: default `feat/F###-<feature>`; optional task branches `feat/F###-<feature>--T##-<task>`.
- Paths: `docs/features/F###-<feature>/{plan.md,evidence.md,coding-notes.md,review.md}`.
- Status values: planned | in_progress | blocked | handoff | done.
