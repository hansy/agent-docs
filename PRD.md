1. Overview
   • Project Name:
   • Version / Date:
   • Status: Draft / In Review / Approved
   • Summary: One-paragraph elevator pitch of what this project/app is.

2. Goals & Non-Goals

Goals
• Clear, measurable objectives this project must achieve.
• Example: “Generate workouts from a single duration input.”

Non-Goals
• What this project explicitly will not do (to avoid scope creep).
• Example: “No wearable integration in v1.”

3. Target Users & Use Cases

Target Users
• Who are the users (personas, demographics, roles)?

Use Cases / Scenarios
• Key real-world problems this project solves.
• Example: “As a user, I want to… so that…”

4. Product Scope
   • MVP Features
   • Future Features (Out of Scope for v1)

5. Functional Requirements
   • Detailed list of features and what each must do.
   • Break down by modules/pages/APIs.
   • Use bullet points or user stories:
   • “The system shall…”
   • “As a user, I can…”

6. Non-Functional Requirements
   • Performance (e.g., must load in <2s).
   • Reliability / Uptime SLAs.
   • Scalability.
   • Security / Privacy constraints.
   • Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc. if relevant).

7. User Experience (UX/UI)
   • Design Principles (minimalist, playful, etc.)
   • Wireframes / Mockups (link or attach).
   • User Flows (step-by-step journey).

8. System Architecture
   • Tech Stack Choices (frontend, backend, database, infra).
   • High-Level Diagram (components and interactions).
   • Dependencies (APIs, third-party services).

9. Data Model
   • Entities & Fields (users, sessions, payments, etc.).
   • Schema draft (tables, collections, etc.).
   • Data flow (input → processing → output).

10. Acceptance Criteria
    • How do we know the feature/project is “done”?
    • Success metrics, user stories with acceptance tests.
    • Example: “When I input 20m, the app generates a safe workout with warm-up, main, and cool-down.”

11. Risks & Assumptions
    • Key risks (technical, market, legal).
    • Mitigation strategies.
    • Assumptions (what must be true for this to work).

12. Rollout Plan
    • Release Strategy (MVP, beta, GA).
    • Phases / Milestones.
    • Metrics to Track Post-Launch.

13. Open Questions
    • Anything undecided that needs stakeholder or team input.

14. Appendices
    • Links to related docs (specs, design files, research).
    • Glossary of terms.
